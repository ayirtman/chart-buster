# Chart-Buster ðŸŽµðŸš€

_Because why should time travellers have all the fun!_

Chart-Buster is a nifty Python script that blasts you into the past, reviving those old, gold hits from the year you wish. It scrapes chart data from Top 40 Weekly, cleans it, and downloads the music tracks from YouTube right into your system. Pretty rad, huh? Time to relive the 70s, the 80s, or any decade you fancy, with Chart-Buster!

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: The script uses Beautiful Soup to scrape the top 40 songs of any given week from the past.
- **Data Cleaning**: It parses and cleans the scrapped data and neatly arranges it in a tabular CSV file.
- **YouTube Search and Download**: Finally, it uses `yt_dlp` to search and download the corresponding music tracks from YouTube.
